# Pattern-Recognition
In this project, we will implement a Handwriting-Based Gender Classification System. Given an input image for a piece of text; the target is to identify the  gender of the writer whether male or female. Human handwriting is used to examine and investigate human characteristics in a variety of applications, such as bank check verification, personality profiling, historical document analysis, and criminological investigation
